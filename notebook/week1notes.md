This week we continued discussing strategies in response to the evolving rule set.  For example we discussed the feasibility of the main role being the keeper.  Based on previous discussions, we made a 3D model for the base of the robot.  However, we later decided that it would be better to prototype with less expensive and time consuming materials.  Finally, we tested the pixy camera and attempted to test servos but we were not able to get those working failure on the servo shield.

This week we began building a prototype for our robot. We decided for now that our basic design revolves around a tricycle-style, two-wheel drive build. We have a rectangular base with several legos attached on each side with the one regular wheel in the front, and two are DC motor wheels in the back. 

In our initial attempt, the back wheels were not properly attached to the base (see first picture), which caused issues with getting the wheels to properly spin. To fix this issue, we decided to cut out a larger foam core base to account for the space in which these wheels would be attached. Small pieces of foam core were placed to stabilize the motor, and the wheels were attached to the base by using multiple screws that went through these layers of foam core. 

In addition, we completed our first milestone as we got the robot to move forward! The robot doesn't move in a straight line, but we believe this will be fixed once we build a sturdier base.
