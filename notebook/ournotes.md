This week we continued discussing strategies in response to the evolving rule set.  For example we discussed the feasibility of the main role being the keeper.  Based on previous discussions, we made a 3D model for the base of the robot.  However, we later decided that it would be better to prototype with less expensive and time consuming materials.  Finally, we tested the pixy camera and attempted to test servos but we were not able to get those working failure on the servo shield.
